CHANGELOG
=========

4.0.0
-----
* Added support of OpenAPI 3.0. The internals were completely reworked and this version introduces BC breaks.

3.7.0
-----

* Added `@SerializedName` annotation support and name converters when using Symfony >= 4.2.
* Removed pattern added from the Expression Violation message.
* Added FOSRestBundle 3.x support
* Added `@SWG` annotations support at methods level in models

3.3.0
-----

* Usage of Google Fonts was removed. System fonts `serif` / `sans` will be used instead.
  This can lead to a different look on different operating systems.
  You can [re-add Google Fonts again manually by overriding the template](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/NelmioApiDocBundle/faq.html#re-add-google-fonts).

* The Twig template for the Swagger UI now contains blocks to make it easier to overwrite certain parts.
  See the [official documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/NelmioApiDocBundle/customization.html) how to do this.

3.2.0 (2018-03-24)
------------------

* Add a documentation form extension. Use the ``documentation`` option to define how a form field is documented.
* Allow references to config definitions in controllers.
* Using `@Model` implicitely in `@SWG\Schema`, `@SWG\Items` and `@SWG\Property` is deprecated. Use `ref=@Model()` instead.

  Before:
  ```php
  /**
   * This was considered as an array of models.
   *
   * @SWG\Property(@Model(type=FooClass::class))
   */
  ```

  After:
  ```php
  /**
   * For an individual object:
   * @SWG\Property(ref=@Model(type=FooClass::class))
   *
   * For an array:
   * @SWG\Property(type="array", @SWG\Items(ref=@Model(type=FooClass::class)))
   */
  ```

Config
* `nelmio_api_doc.areas` added support to filter by host patterns.

  ```

  ```yml
  nelmio_api_doc:
      routes: [ path_patterns: [ /api ] ]
  ```
